# Energy Management and Optimization course

This repository contains MATLAB implementations of various optimization algorithms for energy management and optimization. These algorithms are intended to be used in the context of energy consumption optimization in the Islamic Azad University, Bouin-Zahra Branch.

## Algorithms Implemented

The following optimization algorithms have been implemented in MATLAB:

1. Genetic Algorithm (GA)
2. Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)
3. Black Widow Optimization Algorithm (BWO)
4. Ant Colony Optimization (ACO)
5. Dingo Optimizer Algorithm (DOA)
6. Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO)
7. Dragonfly Algorithm (DA)
8. Harris hawks optimization (HHO)

## Usage

To use these algorithms, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

2. Open MATLAB and navigate to the directory where you cloned the repository.

3. Open the MATLAB scripts corresponding to the desired optimization algorithm.

4. Adjust the algorithm parameters, such as population size, mutation rate, and maximum iterations, according to your requirements.

5. Run the script and observe the optimization process. The script should output the optimized solution and convergence metrics.
